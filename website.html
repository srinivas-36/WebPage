          Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
          such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character
          traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
          role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from
          indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
          improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
          definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
          also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process:
          the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.
          Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one
          generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
          encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed
          for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.

        <p class="secsubtag text-small">
          Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and
          informal education. Formal education takes place in education and
          training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and
          objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most
          regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and
          commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary
          school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
          alternative to formal education.It may be structured according to
          educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually
          takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based
          settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the
          family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
          thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether
          unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from
          the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal
          learning can occur in all three settings.

          Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists
          belonging to diverse fields. Many agree that education is a
          purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the
          transmission of knowledge.But they often include other aims as
          well, such as fostering skills and character traits.
          However, there are deep disagreements about the exact nature of
          education besides these general characteristics. According to some
          conceptions, it is primarily a process that occurs during events like
          schooling, teaching, and learning.Others understand it not
          as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this
          process. On this view, education is what educated persons have, i.e.
          the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of
          them.However, the term may also refer to the academic
          study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and
          learning, as well as the social institutions involved in these
          processes.
